# Hola, I'm Vu ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Developer from Viet Nam. I do creative layouts, and crazy animation in 2D web development most of the time (sometimes I try to do some 3D stuff). I also can do the backend but not too much.

Until now, I have worked on more than 20 projects with clients from Europe and my country, Vietnam.

I also do some **open-source** projects ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡.

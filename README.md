# Hola, I'm Vu ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Developer from Viet Nam. I do creative layouts, and crazy animation in 2D web development most of the time (sometimes I try to do some 3D stuff). I also can do the Backend but not too much.

Until now, I have worked on more than 20 projects with clients from Europe, Thailand, and my country, Vietnam.

I also do some **open-source** projects.

Now, I'm an "unemployed" developer. This is the time that I think I could look back on myself to find out which of the things I could do best and not. Try to learn something new about WebGL âœ¨, interactive projects that I have been dreaming of for a long time.

### Hi, I'm Vu Pham ✌👨‍💻

I work as a ~front-end developer~, no, I'm just a studennt. I'm studying in University, but I'm currently working as a frontend developer at ViiVue

Since 2/2020, I have a big influence with web design, web application, so I have tried to learn some web technologies and web design (about HTML/CSS and some design terminology). I have strongly experience with Vanilla Javascript. And in web developement, we can't be without Framework/Library. And ReactJS is my choice. React is a big library that we should learn to explore all the tools, all the magic that React brings to us.

### What I'm focusing on 🌞
Currently improving my React skills, exploring NodeJS secret, web design technology and terminology.

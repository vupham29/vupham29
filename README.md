### Hi, I'm Vu Pham ‚úåüë®‚Äçüíª

I work as a ~front-end developer~, no, I'm just a studennt. I'm currently studying in University, but I want to become a full-stack engineer. 

Since 2/2020, I have a big influence with web designer, web application, so I have tried to learn some web technologies and web design (about HTML/CSS and some design terminology). I have strongly experience about Vanilla Javascript (I think that because I have spent a lots of time on it, approximately 8 months on only vanilla Javascript). I have built some web projects:
- cinema-dashboard
- translator
- calculator

And in web developement, we can't be without Framework/Library. And ReactJS is my choice. I have learnt ReactJS for 4 months, and I think I can do something with it.

Beside web developer, I have tried to learn Python for my subjects - data analysis and airtifical intelligience. My Python skill is fine, I have built some application in Python, you can try on:
- Scrapping Hackernews Post
- Image Processing
- Auto sending email
